# To configure environment variables:

1. Create a file named ".env" in the project root
2. Copy the following content:

# Environment variables for Campaign Adaptation Software
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBe7KwPkxwpmOr8M7wAOb4bZ6Hpt0X-Mnw

# Optional settings:
# TEMP_DIR=./temp
# OUTPUT_DIR=./output
# LOG_DIR=./logs
# MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=500

3. Save the .env file
4. The .env file is already in .gitignore, so it won't be uploaded to git

NOTE: Your Google API key is included above. Keep this file secure.
